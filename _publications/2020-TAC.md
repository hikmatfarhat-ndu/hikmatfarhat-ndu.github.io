In this paper we investigate the synthesis of a (possibly nondeterministic) supervisor, 
with partial information, such that the controlled nondeterministic plant is bisimulation 
equivalent to a nondeterministic specification. We derive a new necessary and sufficient 
condition for the existence of a supervisor and provide an algorithm for the supervisor 
construction when one exists. The algorithm is exponential in the size of the plant and specification, a substantial improvement over the double exponential cost from exhaustive
search. We show that the cases of complete information and deterministic control are special cases of the presented theory.
