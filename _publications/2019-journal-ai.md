We propose in this paper a qualitative model that allows us to monitor cars in real-time. Our model uses two distinct and complementary formalisms for capturing the relative positions of a large set of cars that are moving over time. The algorithm we propose and implement enables us to answer some high level questions, such as determining if two cars are at a safe distance from each other or if a collision between them is inevitable. The main aim of this paper is to elaborate a model where a set of cars can move safely on a highway.
