abstract={Most of the currently available intrusion detection systems do not provide any authentication functionality in order to identify the users who access a computer system. In particular, insiders are able to misuse their privileges without being detected. Some intrusion detection systems aim to authenticate legitimate users once they log in to the system, as well as to prevent access to unauthorized people who try to impersonate other users. The main goal of this paper is to introduce and implement a novel approach that uses the fingerprint technique to complement a host-based intrusion detection system in order to improve its level of authentication, which would allow us to detect more effectively any misuse of the computer system that is running it.},

abstract={We present a simple and efficient method to optimize the outgoing bandwidth in a multi-homed autonomous systems (AS). This method rely on the properties of the border gateway protocol (BGP) and a simple heuristic to balance the load on all egress links. Taking advantage of the fact that only a small number of ASes are responsible for most traffic we show how the proposed technique is deployed. The results of a simulation on data collected from a real networks shows that the proposed method is promising.},

abstract={Network access control with intrusion detection system capabilities is currently being used to monitor and protect networks from malicious activities. In this paper, we propose a 3-tier architecture of a network access control that uses mobile agents to help reduce the shortcomings of currently available network access control devices. Our idea is to make use of the inherent characteristics of mobile agents in order to better monitor endpoint devices that are connected to a computer network.},

year={2008},

pages={569-572},
abstract={Denial of Service (DoS) attacks present a serious problem for Internet communications. The problem is aggravated when the attacker(s) spoof their IP addresses. The Implicit Token Scheme (ITS), presented in , is an efficient method to defend against IP spoofing. ITS, however, requires perimeter routers to maintain state information for thousands of simultaneous connections. In this paper we add a component to ITS to improve its scalability using Bloom filters. It is found that implementing ITS using Bloom filters is simple, saves a substantial amount of router memory, and does not impose large strain on routers. The efficiency of the method is demonstrated through simulations by using real-world Internet data.},

abstract={Many techniques have been proposed by the research community to mitigate the effect of flooding denial of service (DoS) attacks. The effects of DoS attacks are aggravated by the ability of attackers to hide the source of the attack packets. A widely used class of solutions. (e.g. trace-back) is based on marking packets, from source to destination, by intermediate routers and selectively blocking packets based on the path they traveled. In this paper we show that router level path identification offers more details then needed. We also show that packets originating from a group of devices will follow almost identical paths to the destination. Thus a single attacker can spoof its address in such a way that will lead to a whole group in the source domain to be labeled as attack source. We argue that a more coarse grained path identification, such as the autonomous system path identification, be used instead.},
